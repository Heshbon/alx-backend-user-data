# Session authentication

This project focuses on implementing session authentication from scratch using Python and Flask, without relying on external authentication modules. The primary goal is to understand the mechanics of session-based authentication by developing it manually. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with handling authentication, cookies, and sessionsâ€”key concepts in web development.

## Background Context

Session authentication is a technique used to verify user identity across multiple requests. In real-world applications, established frameworks or modules, such as Flask-HTTPAuth for Flask, are typically used to manage authentication. This project aims to deepen my understanding by building a session authentication system from scratch.
